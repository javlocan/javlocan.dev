# Astro Portfolio

At first this portfolio was planned as a **meta** website, whith insights about it's own code, components, etc.
Astro is a pretty interesting framework for integration, but it will not force the integration.
I will only use React if I need it.

## Goal

_Primary:_ Make a beautiful, intuitive and fast portfolio with the minimal code.
_Secondary:_ Use VSCode with minimal settings, nVim-like. Hands of mouse, faster workflow.

## Features

- IntersectionObserver makes sections appear with a smooth animation

### Last Comments:

- Snappy Scroll disabled for the moment.
- **Tech** React Component => Different Astro Islands for Skills and Tech
